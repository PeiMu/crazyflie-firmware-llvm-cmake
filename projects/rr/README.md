# Readiness Review

This folder contains the code that was used into the drones for the RR presentation (final review).

The code inside this folder is allowing us to manage all the aspect of the drones behaviour.

The implementation of the exploration algorithm can be found in the `exploration` folder

We decided to split some elements in orders to introduce a better understanding and also improve the coding and correction experience.
